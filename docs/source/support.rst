support from others within the team.

GitHub
---------
The primary way of delivering technical support will be via the issue tracker
on the GitHub repository BjerknesCPU/BCPU-support.

  In order to access this repository to use the issue tracker, you will need a
  GitHub account and you will need to be added to the BjerknesCPU GitHub
  organization. To be added to this, please contact BCPU-support@uib.no.

Within the BCPU-support repository on GitHub, navigate to the 'Issues' section
where you should be able to see existing requests. To create your own request
here, select 'New issue' containing the following information:

**Title**

E-mail
---------
In the case that you do not currently have access to the BCPU-support GitHub
repository, there is also a mailing list (BCPU-support@uib.no) to which
technical requests can be directed. These requests will get picked up by
someone in the team, who will respond to the request via email and also copy
the request to the issue tracker.
